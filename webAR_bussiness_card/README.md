My business card is avalible using a Marker i created  
![My target](https://cdn.glitch.global/c50183a0-773d-4a6d-aefe-7423009c0ff0/pattern-frame.png?v=1645821043305)  
Jerome Tienne's [Marker Training](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html "custom marker generator") is a great tool that I used to create this.  
  
After scanning the QR code and opening the .io page, the same image can be used to display the card features.  
Any of the cubes can be hovered over with the circle cursor and the page will redirect to the selected platform after the cursor animation completes.
